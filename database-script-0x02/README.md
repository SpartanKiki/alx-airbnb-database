# Task 3 — Database Seeding (Sample Data)

This folder contains SQL scripts used to populate the Airbnb database with sample data.

## File: `seed.sql`

The script inserts realistic sample data for:

- Users  
- Properties  
- Bookings  
- Payments  
- Reviews

This data helps simulate real-world behavior of the Airbnb platform for testing and development.
